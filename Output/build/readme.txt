Please download the included Galmuri9.ttf. If you don't download it, the game will be ugly.

When you start the game, a white window named Error.exe will pop up, but it's just a bug and should be turned off.

We recommend running the game on your desktop. Otherwise, you might get stuck on the wrong alt-tab.

Please read the tutorial carefully. The game can be unfriendly. We apologize for that.
